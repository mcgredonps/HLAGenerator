# HLAGenerator
Highly experimental, non-functional, just noodling around. 

Given the XML RPR-FOM, can you generate Java classes that correspond to 
the RPR-FOM classes? The idea being that it's easier to deal with Java
classes than it is to mess around with HLA. The idea is to wrap most/all
of the ugly details of HLA behind a nicer Java interface.
